# Matrix-Multiplication-On-Quantum-Computer

This paper primarily investigates the methods of implementing matrix multiplication on quantum computers. 
The five algorithms described in the paper are all available in the __'code'__ directory.
This library is build using jupyter notebooks and the construction of quantum circuits is primarily carried out using the Pennylane platform.

## Libs
pennylane=0.33.1  
pennylane-qiskit=0.33.1	

## Running
Taking the original matrix multiplication algorithm as an example, you can verify the feasibility of quantum matrix multiplication by executing the __'matrix_multiplication_old.ipynb'__ file. Should you wish to evaluate the memory usage of the algorithms, the
``memory_profiler``library can be utilized.
